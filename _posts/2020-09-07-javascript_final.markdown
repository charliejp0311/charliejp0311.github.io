My Java final.  This is the first project that I felt like I had a little better creative control over what was going on.  Java tends to remind me of c++ in the order and little quirks that are must's or nothing works.  This project I took decided to take a part of my current job I have been wihsing was modified or better has been something we call our "dock walk".  During a walk we identify doors that are good for different types of work that we do.  The dock continues to move and change with one job it sets up for another job.  

Our biggest failure is fully communicating the changes that the dock has.  Both to managment and our direct reports.  My goal was simple right now but the potential could be grand if I ever got my managments backing. How do I accomplish this?  Well Java script has allowed me to acheive this.  I broke down the docks the way that I felt was best to compartmentalize the dock.  I also took the task I currently perfom as inspiration for the design it works fine for what it does but the communication can only improve.  

Java itself has been fun overall I think the labs left you a more creative aspect but at the same time could have used some more direction.  Personaly when I wasn't making progress it became hard to ask for help because I had no idea what question I needed to ask.  My overall understanding only grew as I looked for methods I have learned in other languages.  and tried to further my understanding.  I think that I would like to learn more concepts of coding thought process to get to the end result.  I feel like we get stuck in a method or way of processing infromation that makes sense to us.  Learning these other concepts like game theory might help the overall understanding of what you want to do to get through your app it may also help change your overall design thoughts.  Do you make something set thing or something that can be changed.

Personal goals going forward study game theory for personal growth.
