To me when I help some one else it is actually the ultimate test of my knowledge of the subjuct.  To truly be able to teach someone about something is to know it fully.  I think learning and attempting to teach others is also a way of humbling yourself to others as well.  To help someone else in coding you must be able to translate concepts from thier brain and in their personal code as everyone has a similar yet different approach to every problem.  This to me is the most humbling because I have writen code that works but is more complex than nesseccary and someone else needs help but has a different approach to the problem and can help me simplify my code.
