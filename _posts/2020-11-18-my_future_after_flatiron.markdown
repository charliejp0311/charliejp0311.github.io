So I have imagined myself to be a programmer since the internet was in its infancy.  I couldn't afford a computer for a long time and then once I was able to get one it took me a few years to get the internet.  During that time I followed a few different paths trying to find something that caught my interest as the romance behind the "Hacking" of the early '90s.  

I worked retail and found friends that fixed computers to try and immerse myself in them.  At the time I didn't understand that my interest was something I should pursue I think primarily because my family didn't understand computers and technology and where it was going.  

So I worked retail and quickly became bored and no one knew why I did not try and move up.  Instead, once I got out of high school got a second  J O B.  This job was construction-type work, easy and kinda fun you have an engineering aspect to anything with the building of any kind I see that more so now.  I still didn't find a home there.  

In Feb. of 2001, I decided that I wasn't going to be able to afford school or to see the world without joining the military.  Navy wanted me to be a nuclear engineer on a sub no thank you so ... Enter the Marin Corps infantry.  I spent 4 years there lost still as to what I wanted to do with my future.  When I got out my plan was flight school and become a commercial airline pilot, my other love.  Life had other plans and a family in mind for me.

I worked construction again both non-union and union, till the recession hit the construction field in 2006.  From there I worked in a hot forge as a hot inspector.  I would check hot forges for tolerances.  Bad for the lungs next,  Cabinets and Fine woodworks.  This was a mastering of a production skill that I had acquired through construction.  I found beauty in wood and the design of a piece and where you want to draw attention to but I also found an appreciation and beauty in raw nature.  2008 came but didn't wreak havoc in this industry till 2009.  

Enter My current field of Operations in Warehousing.  Starting as a forklift operator I knew I didn't want to be on the bottom here I wanted to make sure if they laid people off I was on the very bottom of the list.  So I started to apply for positions that had more responsibility.  I also decided that solving a problem and saving the company some time and money would be good once I got into a higher position.  

Once there I used a computer all the time.  I also was able to get my hands on local data tables while learning Microsoft Access as that was provided.  I developed a report that looked through the delivery notes for materials that were on a list of materials deemed commercial.  This report allowed Associates to get a list of work and total units needed instead of getting them one at a time with no real information.   The Microsoft Office sweet became a focus of my knowledge after that and I created and implemented macros and spreadsheets across our network of warehouses.

The next promotion was into a supervisory role this was new and different and kept my attention for some time but I have found myself again bored.  Also at a point where I don't want my success tied to people who are at work for a paycheck and not to work.  In my job, I feel that my success is also tied directly to how my manager and my associates like me more so than how well I do my job.  Recently I have found that a partner that is looking towards the same goal is amazing and I need to be with that kind of mentality all the time.

Although this happened at my work and it has made it bearable again I do not want to get trapped in that cycle again and decided to follow a passion again and I started to fly but my savings was drained faster than I expected and I was pushed by loved ones to look back into computers.  At Flatiron I found people were interested in fixing a problem together and helping me understand things.  The positive environment I have been looking for.  Also a passion I have had with a lack of ability to get there.  Flatiron Schools enters into my social media streams as I start going to free coding sites.  I checked it out and decided let's do it.

Now I have gone through their courses and am working with the career placement side now.  My expectations are more focused on finding a similar environment that I can grow in.  A decent salary of course and the ability to work from where ever would be a great plus but I think that I am going to continue to grow as a programmer and continue to find new opportunities.  I have an entrepreneurial spirit as I feel like most people in this field have or we wouldn't want to make our own applications. 

Finding the next great opportunity that is really what is next and how will I know?  I don't think I am supposed to know.  I think the experience is part of the results, it adds to the experiment of our life.
