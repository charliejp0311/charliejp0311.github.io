Well I have been learning to program on my own for a while.  I find it to be almost like building physical things in the satisfaction I get once I am finished.  I think that eventually every job in the world will need to have a programming background so we are on the tip of the spear by doing this now.  

Imagine a future where we are traveling the stars and more often then not how data is interpreted is going to make all the difference.  I can only imagine the improvements we will make in the fields of science and medicine, the more we apply computer science to them.  

Being able to help bring these fields to the fore front is going to rest solely on software engineers.  The faster we get this stage the development of software will slowly move to the people on the front lines.  Getting in now during this development stage where there are so many jobs currently available we will only have a greater opportunity to choose more freely the area we would like to develop further into.

Now I would be lying if I said that money didn't have anything to do with my choice as well.  Currently I am making half of what the mean salary for a software engineer is.  I also feel like there is a lot less perceived responsibility.  I have less direct reports and such.  These are my major stressors in my current career path and I would love to pass those off to the next person wanting to do that.
