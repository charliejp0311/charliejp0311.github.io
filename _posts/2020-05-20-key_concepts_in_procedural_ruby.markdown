Procedural Ruby to me is a process approach to programming that allows for creativity within the process.  I think the description that meant the most to me was the swiss army knife with all it's little tools.  A procedure or process is that little tool.  The creativity is all in how we use the tool.......

How we use the tool. I am reminded of my psy. class when they talked about the idea that for someone with enough money to get the right tool for the job doesn't understand the tool they have fully.  For the guy that can afford a pry bar will never try and pry with a screwdriver and therefore a screwdriver is a screw driver.

I am amazed at how much you can apply that in life and show it through programming itself.  Modifing a container variable into an object utilizing the tools that it has fully I think could take a life time.  This is the founation, the framers square a right angle triangle that has been used to build the world. 

So the tools variables and methods.  Variables being containers and methods being actions for the programm to execute.  Booleans or truthyness this is just like a simple yes no transaction 1 or 0 LOL .  Logic and conditional statments are way's for you to help the program decide what to do 'if this then that' .  Looping are like for this number to that number or 3.times do something this is a loop.  using a boolean you can say print something until printed and set a boolean variable from false to true and loop it this is only technically one loop but the concept ie there.  

Array's is where things get interesting to me the organized storage of data allowing the mapping of the data.  An array is like a row or a column of a spreadsheet.  Iteration to me is going through the 'cells' of the row on the spread sheet.  I also find the hash idea to be like a table with or without a name and column headers or 'keys' and a row of 'values' this alows me to visualize the data in my head.  

Data structures or objects are a way of turning a hash of information into something more understandable and tangible for you to understand. Creating a Dog{name=fido, owner=self} alows you to understand the idea of what you are making and the attributets you are giving the dog that the object can interact with through methods that you create within your program.

I grew up a carpenters son and learned about building structures from a young age and I find these concepts are very visible in data structures and builidng functions and how they build functionality on to a structure.  Being able to visualize the structures as cells and tables in a spread sheet allows me to visualize the tree roots that make up the file structjure of the internet.
