My Final project is all about inventing things.  I have a facination with inventions and inventors.  What is the process behind it.  I have realized that programming is very much inventing.  You are exploring the lines of code and ways to put it together to see if it works.  This is what Nikola Tesla did with electricity, Edison and the light bulb, Bell and the phone.  So the process of inventing something is finding a bigger goal *there's got to be a better way to do this* and then take it down one small problem at a time.

This prooject has been very dificult in a unique way for me.  It has been very challenging as My server has been taking about 2 minutes to reload and for some reason my active refresh isn't working.  I did some searching to try and resolve this but that ended up being troublesome as well.  I would take the 2 minute down time and start searching but then I would be serching for a half an hour and totally lose track of where I was in my project.

I made the decision that I needed to focus on my project only and did searching in the off time in the evening that I had planned.  Speaking of that TIME MANAGMENT is an unruly thing at times I found myself doing it to aggresively and then at times I was not doing it at all.  Focus remained an issue after trying multiple timer apps *note to self make your own interval timer app*.  Finding the best way to do things seems to be the never ending cycle of life LOL.
