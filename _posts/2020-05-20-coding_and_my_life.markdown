So coding in my life has been something of a hobby and desire since I was young.  I was a freshmen in highschool in 1996 and come from a lower middle class family so owning a computer was alway's out of the question.  I did what I could and befriended the school computer Guru who was younger than me but was given computers at a young age since his father worked for the college.  Anyway he was constantly on them and not really teaching anyone much so that was a good attempt in my opinion but failed never the less.  I tried looking into jobs and went to college using my GI bill from my time in the Marine Corps this was dificult with a full time job as a supervisor to support my family and full time class load in college.  My life took some drastic changes and one of them pointed me right back to computers and coding.  Since then with some self reflection I have found that occupying my time with the puzzle of code helps me temporarily leave behind the memories of a dangerous time in my life.  Coding has become theraputic for me it is a way for me to accomplish something and focus on a problem that is complex for long periods of time.
