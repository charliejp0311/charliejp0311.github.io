Basic CLI applications can be fun and I think make for a good way for you to get simple data in a very basic format ASAP.  For my Project I made an app that reached out to an API and got information it then created some objects and went through a couple of menus to show the information that the API was giving me.  

When I started the app I made it all as individual functions and a single menu.  I improved on it by using Objects and creating multiple menu's.   

To improve further I think that I could have made my objects a bit better than what I did.  I think the biggest improvment would be to add a database and track the information over time.  As I am learning, I am finding that we are really improving on our ideas and thoughts about what is better.
