So this project has helped me learn about myself and personal issues I have been having due to the environment that we all have been dealing with.  I definitly need to set a space aside in the house and a better timetable if I want to do this as a work from home job and honestly just to improve myself in general.  

To start I had ton's of trouble deciding what I wanted to do this project on.  While I find creative solutions to problems my creativity with no starting point is not good.  Once I figured out what I wanted to do I started working on the frontend...

Big mistake number ONE is not deciding on the backend.  I spent the first 2 day's deciding what to do it on then the next 3 working on a frontend that I scrapped.

Backend is up and running the way I want it to by day 6 of the project and connecting initially took me day 7. Day 8 I spent working on the react app again and started pulling what I could salvage from my first build into my second build.  Day 9 making sure the functionality was there turned into a nightmare I had to change from a made up dtabase to a real one and make sure it worked.

I was able to get it to add to my backend and everything before day 10 now I am running into issues with how it is together I think that I could be writing less code if I was putting things in the correct places to utilise what I need to but am affraid that I will just have to keep plugging away.  

THis blog post has been a break for me and a recap of where I am so I can go back and hopefully remember why I need to manage My time better and what not.
