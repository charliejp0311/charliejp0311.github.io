So far I think that as far as a cheat sheet for myself goes:

ALWAYS END EVERYTHING AS SOON AS YOU OPEN IT.
This will help you not get a errors of missing closing statments and prevent future bugs

Array's are comma seperated hash pairs are comma seperated

GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND
Always work trough your problems one error at a time and google them if they don't make sense to you.

My grandma always said that many hands make light work some goes for working through a problem many heads make light work ~ask for help!
