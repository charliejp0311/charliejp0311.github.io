So I have done a ton of self taught coding to get ahead in my current job.  Not that I haven't taken any classes in coding before but none dealt with my everyday needs.  So I learned to hack my way through repetative tasks in VBA.  How?  Google!

I would find myself researching answers to problems I had for hours while neglecting other things all to make the repetative tasks easier to handle.   This is what a hacker is someone who finds an easier way of doing things by exploiting code to perform these.  

I don't know how many times I would write and re-write code trying to improve my understanding of the code.  The speed of the code.  When I finally took a college level class for Excel I would break functions in cells but the logic would stand in the background VBA.  So what was needed more research on passing variable results into cells.

Ultimatly I have to say that I was never stuck I just wasn't utilising my resouces.  There was also another thing gained from learning my resources that sometimes goes un-mentioned and that is the methods you use to look up what you are trying to do.  

Understanding your vocab in this field is definitley KEY to research and making the best use of your time researching.  I mentioned earlier writing and re-writing.  This is all from nit understanding how to look up what I wanted to do from a lack of understanding my vocab.

So far this boot camp has definitely left me questioning my knowledge and abilities.  I have been able to stay with about the top 15 or so out of everyone but I still am trying to affirm my understanding.  I feel like my continued use of a language and understanding of how and why I am applying the methods I apply.  I am also excited and a little nervous about starting the pair programming.  I am excited to learn someone elses knowledge and approach.  I am nervous that I am going to be the one with more knowledge and will feel responsible for the other persoons success.
