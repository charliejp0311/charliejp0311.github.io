My concept on this project was kind of a whim from a video posted.  I thought the idea of a recipe app sounded intriguing and stopped watching the video to run with my own vision of the app with no inflection from anyone else, could I do it?  

To start my thought was to do this for an event to get everyone started in it.  Let's all bring things to eat and upload our recipes.  Once they are up and we have tried them we can comment on each recipe and make suggestions or in turn devise your Own ingredients and post a personal version.

Things are seeming to come into focus for me they in my feeling are getting repetitive enough I can visualize the patterns.  My elements are looking like stats on a spreadsheet so to speak in my head.  They are looking like directions on a map or buttons to teleport you to information, games, and even, a social life.  

So to make this all happen I created users and added passwords for them.  I also then created the map to create a new user delete yourself and change yourself.   My next step was to make recipes.  I wanted them to have the name or title of the dish, the ingredients and suggested cook time.  Finally, I wanted to be able to comment on the recipes.  

The main pages displayed with views are the recipe pages for the site.  After you make your user account you will spend most of your time on that recipes/index page.  This will have all the recipes submitted to the site on it with the last comment posted to it.  These are links to the recipe show page where you can see who made the recipe, the recipe, and comments that have been made about that specific recipe.
